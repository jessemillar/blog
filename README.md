I'm not a huge fan of [blog platforms](https://medium.com/) and I prefer using [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) as my text editor whenever possible (sorry, WYSIWYG interfaces). I sometimes have thoughts that are worth putting down in long-form and sharing out and this repository will serve that purpose.

Welcome to my blog!
