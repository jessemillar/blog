# Personal Postmortems

I've had great success in using personal postmortem documents when trying to learn from a failure (big or small). I found a simple postmortem template that I liked and spun up a public repo (public inside my company) to host all my docs. At the end of projects/sprints/individual feature development, I write a postmortem and share it out with the team. Sharing helps me be accountable, foster a culture that accepts failure at varying levels, and inspires other people to also self-examine and learn as much as possible from their individual experiences.
