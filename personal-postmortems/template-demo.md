# (Put a Catchy Postmortem Title Here)

## Summary

Write a brief, one-paragraph summary of what happened/what you worked on. Put enough detail that someone can skim and quickly understand what's going on but don't bog things down with technical details or griping. Try to be objective. When referencing yourself, either speak in the third person or make it very clear who wrote the document. "I" or "me" might not make sense to someone else later on.

## What Didn't Go Well

Give an overview of what didn't go well. Use a list for better readability. If things really didn't go well, it's natural to have negative emotions, but don't use this section to rant. Look at data and facts. Don't be afraid to mention people by name, but try not to throw people under the bus. Examples below.

- Jesse overpromised and didn't deliver the feature on time
- Jesse got in an argument with a teammate which ended up being silly because we were actually on the same page
- Jesse isn't entirely proud of the code he ended up writing (lots of "here be dragons" comments)

## What Went Well

For this section, format similarly to the "What Didn't Go Well" section, but instead talk about the things that *did* go well. Don't try to use this section to override or hedge the "What Didn't Go Well" section. Be objective, factual, and aware of your latent emotions. Loose examples follow. Be specific in your actual postmortem.

- Jesse learned a lot about a new technology
- We have a more defined PR process in place
- Jesse added a lot of explanatory comments to our code

## Results

Make a list of lessons you learned and what you're going to do differently in the future. Also list (and link to if possible) any files, documents, etc. that came about as a result of whatever your postmortem is discussing. Bullets are your friend here.

- Jesse should be more realistic in the future when deciding how much work he can take on in a set amount of time. It would have been better if he'd only promised to deliver parts X and Y before the end of the month instead of also including Z.
- Our documentation could use some improvement and it doesn't take much effort. Jesse was able to create [a new onboarding page]() with links to six other pages to help our interns get up to speed.
- [A not-yet-closed PR]() that still needs a couple reviews.
- [A new web page]() explaining the feature to our customers.

## Appendix

All appendix sections are optional and should only be included if relevant.

### Links

Put a list of relevant links here. Some generic examples are shown below.

- [A link to a PR discussion]()
- [A wiki page outlining a design or timeline]()
- [A web page outlining a conference you went to]()

### Timeline

Fill this section with a list of timestamps showing what happened in what order. In most cases, you likely won't need to be more granular than a day, but make sure you include the year for future readers.

- [4/15/2020] Jesse was given the task and started researching
- [4/16/2020] Jesse pair programmed with someone
- [4/21/2020] Jesse fought with a technology
