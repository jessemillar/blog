# Skateboarding at Work
# How to go fast without dying (if I go the longboarding route)

- Reference the open-nnes of the skateboarding community
	- Community is important (foster a good community)
- What makes it hard to iterate in a large corporation/environment?
	- What makes it hard to iterate when everything's on fire?
	- What makes it hard when there's 50 regions?
	- Why is there a fear of judgement?
		- Preventing sharing your work until it's a LOT of work keeps people from offering real feedback (because they don't want to belittle all the work you put in even if they could improve it)
- Quantity over quality
- Quantity leads to quality
- Most important to have discussion and you can't easily have discussion without something tangible
- Documentation helps bridge the gap between quantity and quality (and making future coworkers not hate you)
	- ADRs
	- Postmortems ("personal" and otherwise)

- Small companies employees will likely be the main audience

- When I started skating at skateparks, I was nervous and didn't do tricks that I wasn't confident with. I didn't learn very quickly that way. It wasn't until I started trying and failing and asking for help that I started progressing quickly!

- Think of specific instances to draw material from
	- Focus on scenarios you know well and could speak 5x more about than you are because of time constraints

- The principle developer you fear right now was once in your shoes falling on his knees in the halfpipe
	- He's not gonna shank you

- Find a story you want to tell (tie the whole thing together with the story; start, middle, and end)
	- A lot of your are probably here currently (stuck in PR review or writing tests, etc.)
		- How do you use skateboarding to make things faster?

- Getting back on the horse
	- Talk about hurting myself and getting back into skating


- Entire first half of the talk is about skateboarding
- Second half is about applying the concepts to work

TODO: Mention inclusive open-source communities (or inner-source if I wanna keep it that way)
TODO: Include a Tony Hawk tweet/story when talking about the skating community
TODO: Look up devops fast iteration principles/quotes and work those in specifically when talking about iterating quickly on the software projects I work on
TODO: You might also include something somewhere like "HEY I LEARNED THESE LESSONS WORKING ON A MASSIVE SYSTEM" i.e. "lessons learned from working on one the world's largest multi-cluster Kubernetes system."

Make sure I talk about SRE to skateboarding AND skateboarding to SRE. Gotta be bidirectional.

##### Outline

- Overcoming fear
	- Fostering a good community
	- Documenting stuff in a common language
		- ADRs take five minutes to write but save you hours onboarding new people (like "heelside" terminology is used to quickly explain tricks)
- Quantity over quality
	- Quantity leads to quality
- Getting back on the board after failure
