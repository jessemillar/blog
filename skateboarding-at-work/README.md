# Speaker Bio

Jesse is a site reliability engineer working on Microsoft's Azure Kubernetes Service. He started skateboarding when he was ten-years-old and finally gave skating bigger ramps and skateparks a shot a few years ago. It was scary at first but good grief has it been worth it! Coincidentally, Jesse started programming around the same time he started skating. After eighteen years of skating and programming, Jesse's not a master of either, but he loves them both and has plenty of experience to share! Skateboarding and programming are all about iteration after all!

# Overview

You've likely heard the "rapid iteration" metaphor of building "a skateboard first, then a bike, and then a car." Today, we're going to take that metaphor literally and talk about skateboarding! To skate, you only need a few things: A board, a chill attitude, creativity, and a little bravery. Let's hang out at the skatepark and learn some sick skating lessons that can be applied to DevOps and site reliability engineering!

Some rad things we'll learn at the park:

- Overcoming fear paralysis and how dropping in on a big ramp is just like getting started with a new programming prototype
- Quantity over quality, or how practicing with friends makes you better in skating and programming, bruh!
- Getting back on the board after failure and how you didn't fail, you learned

Skateboarding is scary, but skaters just want to help other skaters. The same goes for coding and programmers! That super experienced principal engineer you're afraid of was once falling in the halfpipe (and probably still does) just like you. Now grab your board and let's skate!
