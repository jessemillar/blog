I'm not professionally employed by the game industry, but I am a professional programmer working in [big tech](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) and I've been playing, studying, and building videogames [in various forms](https://jessemillar.itch.io) for over fifteen years.

Videogames are art.

They can be a beautiful escape, especially in this time of global pandemic.

There's no right or wrong way to play games.

The catch is that there are plenty of ways to set yourself up for a bad time
Games are super complex. It often takes large groups of professional designers and programmers multiple years to put together a high quality gaming experience. When a team undertakes a project of that scale, they're faced with some pretty tough decisions. Should the player be allowed to kill certain characters? Can we actually implement this cool teleportation ability without accidentally warping the player inside a wall? How do we keep the in-game economy from collapsing on itself?

Just don't fill your bathtub with milk, soak in it for a few hours, and then complain to the dairy farmer that it didn't quench your thirst.

With all that said, there's a stigma in the gaming community (at least in the cesspools of certain internet forums) that it's not okay to change the difficulty mode of a game.
It's okay to play on "easy" mode
Take the first couple Uncharted games for example. They're primarily narrative games telling the story of <character name>. The combat systems help you feel the excitement and adventure and the puzzles help you stay engaged with the story. The game isn't trying to be the next e-sport though. If you're like me, and work a full-time job and don't want to dedicate 10+ hours to one game, don't be afraid to crank that difficulty setting down!

So, please, let's play more games. Let's play more games together. Let's tell and experience more stories. And let's make the world a happier place!
